Issues
======

1. There's no issues page for this repo. Fix that.
2. Why are we not using some templating language? Hell, even plain PHP would've 
been fine. I see an include statement, but don't see the file.
3. Foundation grids are not being used properly.
4. I want to burn this with fire and rebuild it gloriously.
