        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>The Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS) is an active student organization that is responsible for bridging the gap between technical students, faculty and the outside world at <a href="http://rutgers.edu"> Rutgers University </a>.</p>
          <p>USACS will proudly be hosting HackRU for the third time! The event is a 24-hour hackathon. It will begin on October 12th at 2:00pm and conclude on October 13th at 3:00pm. There will be companies presenting their APIs so that students can explore them and create amazing applications.</p> 
          <p>Recently, USACS has been avidly supporting a hacker culture and promoting active involvement in hackathons and programming contests in the area. In the past two years, Rutgers students have attended over 25 hackathons and have won multiple prizes in 12 of them. Rutgers is a central hub for amazing and resourceful programmers. We are asking you for your help to tap into the sheer talent that is hidden within the walls of Rutgers and organize an event that will be an incredible          experience for learning and creation.</p>
